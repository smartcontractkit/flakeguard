Use zerolog for logging, passing in the log directly or through context when necessary. Fields should be in snakeCase. Logs should contain helpful debug and execution info. Along with each Info log, consider if you should also include a print statement to inform the end user. Consider that print statements will be weaved in with typical gotestsum output.

For log context:
Warn: Something the user should be informed of that can severely affect how the program works. Always print to stdout.
Info: Some large step has been completed. Consider also printing to stdout for end-user.
Debug: A smaller step has started/completed.
Trace: A tiny step has started/completed.
